# GPT-3 Chatbot

This is a simple chatbot built using OpenAI's GPT-3 API and Streamlit. The chatbot generates responses to user input by using the powerful text generation capabilities of GPT-3.

## Getting Started

To use this code, you will need to have an OpenAI API key. You can sign up for a free API key at the [OpenAI website](https://beta.openai.com/signup/). Once you have your API key, replace the value of `openai.api_key` with your own API key.

You will also need to install the necessary Python packages. You can do this by running:

```
pip install openai streamlit
```

To run the chatbot, run the following command:

```
streamlit run chatbot.py
```

This will start a Streamlit server and open the chatbot in your web browser.

## How it Works

The chatbot works by taking user input and passing it to the OpenAI GPT-3 API to generate a response. The response is then displayed to the user in a text area.

When the user enters a message, the following steps occur:

1. The user's input is passed to the OpenAI API as a prompt.
2. The GPT-3 engine generates a response to the prompt.
3. The response is returned to the chatbot and displayed to the user.

The `max_tokens` parameter specifies the maximum number of tokens (words and punctuation) that the GPT-3 engine should use to generate the response. You can adjust this parameter to control the length of the responses generated by the chatbot.
